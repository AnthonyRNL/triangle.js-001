# Triangle JS Edition

## Background

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle inequality_.

## Tests
When you finish passing a test, remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

To run the specs follow these commands:
```shell
# first install the new gem to run the tests
gem sources -a http://flatiron:33west26@gems.flatironschool.com
gem install ironboard

# to run in the command line run
ironboard

#to run in the browser
ironboard -b
```
